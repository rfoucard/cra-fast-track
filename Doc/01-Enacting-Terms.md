    That cybersecurity risk assessment shall comprise at least an analysis of cybersecurity risks based on the intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use, as well as the conditions of use, of the product with digital elements, such as the operational environment or the assets to be protected, taking into account the length of time the product is expected to be in use.
    The cybersecurity risk assessment shall indicate whether and, if so in what manner, the security requirements set out in Part I, point (2), of Annex I are applicable to the relevant product with digital elements and how those requirements are implemented as informed by the cybersecurity risk assessment.
    It shall also indicate how the manufacturer is to apply Part I, point (1), of Annex I and the vulnerability handling requirements set out in Part II of Annex I.
  </li>

  <li>
    When placing a product with digital elements on the market, the manufacturer shall <strong>include the cybersecurity risk assessment</strong> referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article <strong>in the technical documentation</strong> required pursuant to Article 31 and Annex VII.
    For products with digital elements as referred to in Article 12, which are also subject to other Union legal acts, the cybersecurity risk assessment may be part of the risk assessment required by those Union legal acts.
    Where certain essential cybersecurity requirements are not applicable to the product with digital elements, the manufacturer shall include a clear justification to that effect in that technical documentation.
  </li>

  <li>For the purpose of complying with paragraph 1, manufacturers shall <strong>exercise due diligence</strong> when integrating components sourced from third parties so that those components do not compromise the cybersecurity of the product with digital elements, including when integrating components of free and open-source software that have not been made available on the market in the course of a commercial activity.</li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall, upon identifying a vulnerability in a component, including in an open source-component, which is integrated in the product with digital elements <strong>report the vulnerability</strong> to the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the component, and address and remediate the vulnerability in accordance with the vulnerability handling requirements set out in Part II of Annex I.
    Where manufacturers have developed a software or hardware modification to address the vulnerability in that component, they shall share the relevant code or documentation with the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the component, where appropriate in a machine-readable format.
  </li>

  <li>The manufacturers shall systematically <strong>document</strong>, in a manner that is proportionate to the nature and the cybersecurity risks, <strong>relevant cybersecurity aspects</strong> concerning the products with digital elements, including vulnerabilities of which they become aware and any relevant information provided by third parties, and shall, where applicable, update the cybersecurity risk assessment of the products.</li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall <strong>ensure</strong>, when placing a product with digital elements on the market, and for the support period, <strong>that vulnerabilities</strong> of that product, including its components, <strong>are handled effectively</strong> and in accordance with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part II of Annex I.
    <p>Manufacturers shall <strong>determine the support period</strong> so that it reflects the length of time during which the product is expected to be in use, taking into account, in particular, reasonable user expectations, the nature of the product, including its intended purpose, as well as relevant Union law determining the lifetime of products with digital elements. When determining the support period, manufacturers may also take into account the support periods of products with digital elements offering a similar functionality placed on the market by other manufacturers, the availability of the operating environment, the support periods of integrated components that provide core functions and are sourced from third parties as well as relevant guidance provided by the dedicated administrative cooperation group (ADCO) established pursuant to Article 52(15) and the Commission. The matters to be taken into account in order to determine the support period shall be considered in a manner that ensures proportionality.</p>
    <p>Without prejudice to the second subparagraph, <strong>the support period shall be at least five years</strong>. Where the product with digital elements is expected to be in use for less than five years, the support period shall correspond to the expected use time.</p>
    <p>Taking into account ADCO recommendations as referred to in Article 52(16), <strong>the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the minimum support period for specific product categories</strong> where the market surveillance data suggests inadequate support periods.</p>
    <p>Manufacturers shall <strong>include the information that was taken into account to determine the support period</strong> of a product with digital elements in the technical documentation as set out in Annex VII.</p>
    <p>Manufacturers shall <strong>have appropriate policies and procedures</strong>, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies, referred to in Part II, point (5), of Annex I to process and remediate potential vulnerabilities in the product with digital elements reported from internal or external sources.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Manufacturers shall <strong>ensure that each security update</strong>, as referred to in Part II, point (8), of Annex I, which has been made available to users during the support period, <strong>remains available after it has been issued for a minimum of 10 years</strong> or for the remainder of the support period, whichever is longer.</li>

  <li>Where a manufacturer has placed <strong>subsequent substantially modified versions of a software product</strong> on the market, that manufacturer may <strong>ensure compliance with the essential cybersecurity requirement</strong> set out in Part II, point (2), of Annex I only for the version that it has last placed on the market, provided that the users of the versions that were previously placed on the market have access to the version last placed on the market <strong>free of charge</strong> and <strong>do not incur additional costs to adjust the hardware and software environment</strong> in which they use the original version of that product.</li>

  <li>Manufacturers may <strong>maintain public software archives</strong> enhancing user access to historical versions. In those cases, users shall be clearly informed in an easily accessible manner about risks associated with using unsupported software.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Before placing a product with digital elements on the market, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation</strong> referred to in Article 31.
    <p>They shall carry out the chosen conformity assessment procedures as referred to in Article 32 or have them carried out.</p>
    <p>Where compliance of the product with digital elements with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part I of Annex I and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part II of Annex I has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 28 and affix the CE marking in accordance with Article 30.</p>
  </li>
