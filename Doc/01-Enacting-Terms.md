    Products with digital elements which have the core functionality of a product category set out in Annex III shall be considered to be important products with digital elements and shall be subject to the conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 32(2) and (3).
    The integration of a product with digital elements which has the core functionality of a product category set out in Annex III shall not in itself render the product in which it is integrated subject to the conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 32(2) and (3).
  </li>

  <li>
    The categories of products with digital elements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, divided into classes I and II as set out in Annex III, meet at least one of the following criteria:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        the product with digital elements primarily performs functions critical to the cybersecurity of other products, networks or services, including securing authentication and access, intrusion prevention and detection, end-point security or network protection;
      </li>
      <li>
        the product with digital elements performs a function which carries a significant risk of adverse effects in terms of its intensity and ability to disrupt, control or cause damage to a large number of other products or to the health, security or safety of its users through direct manipulation, such as a central system function, including network management, configuration control, virtualisation or processing of personal data.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to amend Annex III by including in the list a new category within each class of the categories of products with digital elements and specifying its definition, moving a category of products from one class to the other or withdrawing an existing category from that list.
    When assessing the need to amend the list set out in Annex III, the Commission shall take into account the cybersecurity-related functionalities or the function and the level of cybersecurity risk posed by the products with digital elements as set out by the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.
    <p>
      The delegated acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall, where appropriate, provide for a minimum transitional period of 12 months, in particular where a new category of important products with digital elements is added to class I or II or is moved from class I to II as set out in Annex III, before the relevant conformity assessment procedures as referred to in Article 32(2) and (3) start applying, unless a shorter transitional period is justified on imperative grounds of urgency.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    By 11 December 2025, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act specifying the technical description of the categories of products with digital elements under classes I and II as set out in Annex III and the technical description of the categories of products with digital elements as set out in Annex IV.
    That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).

  <summary><strong>Article 8 - Critical products with digital elements</strong> The Commission may require Annex IV products to get an EU cybersecurity certificate (at least “substantial”), can update Annex IV by delegated acts, and must usually allow a 6-month transition.</summary>
  <br/>
  <ol>
  <li>
    The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to supplement this Regulation to determine which products with digital elements that have the core functionality of a product category that is set out in Annex IV to this Regulation are to be required to obtain a European cybersecurity certificate at assurance level at least ‘substantial’ under a European cybersecurity certification scheme adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881, to demonstrate conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation or parts thereof, provided that a European cybersecurity certification scheme covering those categories of products with digital elements has been adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 and is available to manufacturers.
    Those delegated acts shall specify the required assurance level that shall be proportionate to the level of cybersecurity risk associated with the products with digital elements and shall take account of their intended purpose, including the critical dependency on them by essential entities as referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.
    <p>
      Before adopting such delegated acts, the Commission shall carry out an assessment of the potential market impact of the envisaged measures and shall carry out consultations with relevant stakeholders, including the European Cybersecurity Certification Group established under Regulation (EU) 2019/881.
      The assessment shall take into account the readiness and the capacity level of the Member States for the implementation of the relevant European cybersecurity certification scheme.
      Where no delegated acts as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph have been adopted, products with digital elements which have the core functionality of a product category as set out in Annex IV shall be subject to the conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 32(3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The delegated acts referred to in the first subparagraph shall provide for a minimum transitional period of six months, unless a shorter transitional period is justified for imperative reasons of urgency.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to amend Annex IV by adding or withdrawing categories of critical products with digital elements.
    When determining such categories of critical products with digital elements and the required assurance level, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall take into account the criteria referred to in Article 7(2) and ensure that the categories of products with digital elements meet at least one of the following criteria:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>there is a critical dependency of essential entities as referred to in Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on the category of products with digital elements;</li>
      <li>incidents and exploited vulnerabilities concerning the category of products with digital elements could lead to serious disruptions of critical supply chains across the internal market.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Before adopting such delegated acts, the Commission shall carry out an assessment of the type referred to in paragraph 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delegated acts referred to in the first subparagraph shall provide for a minimum transitional period of six months, unless a shorter transitional period is justified for imperative reasons of urgency.
