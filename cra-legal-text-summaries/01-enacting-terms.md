# Cyber Resilience Act – Enacting Terms

The enacting terms are the binding core of the Regulation: they set out the actual legal rules that apply in practice. They define scope, definitions, roles and responsibilities, and they establish concrete obligations, procedures, deadlines, and enforcement mechanisms. They also specify who must do what, when, and how, and they may empower the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts to fill in technical details over time. **In short: enacting terms provide the “what” and “how”.**

  <li>For the purpose of complying with paragraph 1, manufacturers shall <strong>undertake an assessment of the cybersecurity risks</strong> associated with a product with digital elements and take the outcome of that assessment into account during the planning, design, development, production, delivery and maintenance phases of the product with digital elements with a view to minimising cybersecurity risks, preventing incidents and minimising their impact, including in relation to the health and safety of users.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>The cybersecurity risk assessment shall be documented and updated</strong> as appropriate during a support period to be determined in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article.
    That cybersecurity risk assessment shall comprise at least an analysis of cybersecurity risks based on the intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use, as well as the conditions of use, of the product with digital elements, such as the operational environment or the assets to be protected, taking into account the length of time the product is expected to be in use.
    The cybersecurity risk assessment shall indicate whether and, if so in what manner, the security requirements set out in Part I, point (2), of Annex I are applicable to the relevant product with digital elements and how those requirements are implemented as informed by the cybersecurity risk assessment.
    It shall also indicate how the manufacturer is to apply Part I, point (1), of Annex I and the vulnerability handling requirements set out in Part II of Annex I.
  </li>

  <li>
    When placing a product with digital elements on the market, the manufacturer shall <strong>include the cybersecurity risk assessment</strong> referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article <strong>in the technical documentation</strong> required pursuant to Article 31 and Annex VII.
    For products with digital elements as referred to in Article 12, which are also subject to other Union legal acts, the cybersecurity risk assessment may be part of the risk assessment required by those Union legal acts.
    Where certain essential cybersecurity requirements are not applicable to the product with digital elements, the manufacturer shall include a clear justification to that effect in that technical documentation.
  </li>

  <li>For the purpose of complying with paragraph 1, manufacturers shall <strong>exercise due diligence</strong> when integrating components sourced from third parties so that those components do not compromise the cybersecurity of the product with digital elements, including when integrating components of free and open-source software that have not been made available on the market in the course of a commercial activity.</li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall, upon identifying a vulnerability in a component, including in an open source-component, which is integrated in the product with digital elements <strong>report the vulnerability</strong> to the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the component, and address and remediate the vulnerability in accordance with the vulnerability handling requirements set out in Part II of Annex I.
    Where manufacturers have developed a software or hardware modification to address the vulnerability in that component, they shall share the relevant code or documentation with the person or entity manufacturing or maintaining the component, where appropriate in a machine-readable format.
  </li>

  <li>The manufacturers shall systematically <strong>document</strong>, in a manner that is proportionate to the nature and the cybersecurity risks, <strong>relevant cybersecurity aspects</strong> concerning the products with digital elements, including vulnerabilities of which they become aware and any relevant information provided by third parties, and shall, where applicable, update the cybersecurity risk assessment of the products.</li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall <strong>ensure</strong>, when placing a product with digital elements on the market, and for the support period, <strong>that vulnerabilities</strong> of that product, including its components, <strong>are handled effectively</strong> and in accordance with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part II of Annex I.
    <p>Manufacturers shall <strong>determine the support period</strong> so that it reflects the length of time during which the product is expected to be in use, taking into account, in particular, reasonable user expectations, the nature of the product, including its intended purpose, as well as relevant Union law determining the lifetime of products with digital elements. When determining the support period, manufacturers may also take into account the support periods of products with digital elements offering a similar functionality placed on the market by other manufacturers, the availability of the operating environment, the support periods of integrated components that provide core functions and are sourced from third parties as well as relevant guidance provided by the dedicated administrative cooperation group (ADCO) established pursuant to Article 52(15) and the Commission. The matters to be taken into account in order to determine the support period shall be considered in a manner that ensures proportionality.</p>
    <p>Without prejudice to the second subparagraph, <strong>the support period shall be at least five years</strong>. Where the product with digital elements is expected to be in use for less than five years, the support period shall correspond to the expected use time.</p>
    <p>Taking into account ADCO recommendations as referred to in Article 52(16), <strong>the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the minimum support period for specific product categories</strong> where the market surveillance data suggests inadequate support periods.</p>
    <p>Manufacturers shall <strong>include the information that was taken into account to determine the support period</strong> of a product with digital elements in the technical documentation as set out in Annex VII.</p>
    <p>Manufacturers shall <strong>have appropriate policies and procedures</strong>, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies, referred to in Part II, point (5), of Annex I to process and remediate potential vulnerabilities in the product with digital elements reported from internal or external sources.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Manufacturers shall <strong>ensure that each security update</strong>, as referred to in Part II, point (8), of Annex I, which has been made available to users during the support period, <strong>remains available after it has been issued for a minimum of 10 years</strong> or for the remainder of the support period, whichever is longer.</li>

  <li>Where a manufacturer has placed <strong>subsequent substantially modified versions of a software product</strong> on the market, that manufacturer may <strong>ensure compliance with the essential cybersecurity requirement</strong> set out in Part II, point (2), of Annex I only for the version that it has last placed on the market, provided that the users of the versions that were previously placed on the market have access to the version last placed on the market <strong>free of charge</strong> and <strong>do not incur additional costs to adjust the hardware and software environment</strong> in which they use the original version of that product.</li>

  <li>Manufacturers may <strong>maintain public software archives</strong> enhancing user access to historical versions. In those cases, users shall be clearly informed in an easily accessible manner about risks associated with using unsupported software.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Before placing a product with digital elements on the market, manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation</strong> referred to in Article 31.
    <p>They shall carry out the chosen conformity assessment procedures as referred to in Article 32 or have them carried out.</p>
    <p>Where compliance of the product with digital elements with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part I of Annex I and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Part II of Annex I has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 28 and affix the CE marking in accordance with Article 30.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Manufacturers shall <strong>keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities</strong> for at least 10 years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the support period, whichever is longer.</li>

  <li>Manufacturers shall <strong>ensure that procedures are in place for products with digital elements that are part of a series of production</strong> to remain in conformity with this Regulation. Manufacturers shall adequately take into account changes in the development and production process or in the design or characteristics of the product with digital elements and changes in the harmonised standards, European cybersecurity certification schemes or common specifications as referred to in Article 27 by reference to which the conformity of the product with digital elements is declared or by application of which its conformity is verified.</li>

    They shall allow for the secure installation, operation and use of products with digital elements.
    Manufacturers shall keep the information and instructions to the user set out in Annex II at the disposal of users and market surveillance authorities for at least 10 years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the support period, whichever is longer.
    Where such information and instructions are provided online, manufacturers shall ensure that they are accessible, user-friendly and available online for at least 10 years after the product with digital elements has been placed on the market or for the support period, whichever is longer.
  </li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall <strong>ensure that the end date of the support period</strong> referred to in paragraph 8, including at least the month and the year, <strong>is clearly and understandably specified</strong> at the time of purchase in an easily accessible manner and, where applicable, on the product with digital elements, its packaging or by digital means.
    <p>Where technically feasible in light of the nature of the product with digital elements, manufacturers shall display a notification to users informing them that their product with digital elements has reached the end of its support period.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall either <strong>provide a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or a simplified EU declaration of conformity</strong> with the product with digital elements.
    Where a simplified EU declaration of conformity is provided, it shall contain the exact internet address at which the full EU declaration of conformity can be accessed.
  </li>

  <li>From the placing on the market and for the support period, manufacturers who know or have reason to believe that the product with digital elements or the processes put in place by the manufacturer are not in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I shall <strong>immediately take the corrective measures</strong> necessary to bring that product with digital elements or the manufacturer’s processes into conformity, or to withdraw or recall the product, as appropriate.</li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers shall, <strong>upon a reasoned request from a market surveillance authority, provide</strong> that authority, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority, <strong>with all the information and documentation</strong>, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with digital elements and of the processes put in place by the manufacturer with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I.
    Manufacturers shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any measures taken to eliminate the cybersecurity risks posed by the product with digital elements which they have placed on the market.
  </li>

  <li>A manufacturer that ceases its operations and, as a result, is not able to comply with this Regulation shall <strong>inform, before the cessation of operations takes effect</strong>, the relevant market surveillance authorities as well as, by any means available and to the extent possible, the users of the relevant products with digital elements placed on the market, <strong>of the impending cessation of operations.</strong></li>

  <li><strong>The Commission may</strong>, by means of implementing acts taking into account European or international standards and best practices, <strong>specify the format and elements of the software bill of materials</strong> referred to in Part II, point (1), of Annex I. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).</li>

  <li>
    In order to assess the dependence of Member States and of the Union as a whole on software components and in particular on components qualifying as free and open-source software, <strong>ADCO may decide to conduct a Union wide dependency assessment for specific categories of products with digital elements</strong>.
    For that purpose, market surveillance authorities may request manufacturers of such categories of products with digital elements to provide the relevant software bills of materials as referred to in Part II, point (1), of Annex I.
    On the basis of such information, the market surveillance authorities may provide ADCO with anonymised and aggregated information about software dependencies.
    ADCO shall submit a report on the results of the dependency assessment to the Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.

        it has led or is capable of leading to the introduction or execution of malicious code in a product with digital elements or in the network and information systems of a user of the product with digital elements.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Where necessary, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification may request manufacturers to provide an intermediate report on relevant status updates about the actively exploited vulnerability or severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements.
  </li>

  <li>
    The notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article shall be submitted via the single reporting platform referred to in Article 16 using one of the electronic notification end-points referred to in Article 16(1). The notification shall be submitted using the electronic notification end-point of the CSIRT designated as coordinator of the Member State where the manufacturers have their main establishment in the Union and shall be simultaneously accessible to ENISA.
    <p>For the purposes of this Regulation, a manufacturer shall be considered to have its main establishment in the Union in the Member State where the decisions related to the cybersecurity of its products with digital elements are predominantly taken. If such a Member State cannot be determined, the main establishment shall be considered to be in the Member State where the manufacturer concerned has the establishment with the highest number of employees in the Union.</p>
    <p>Where a manufacturer has no main establishment in the Union, it shall submit the notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 using the electronic notification end-point of the CSIRT designated as coordinator in the Member State determined pursuant to the following order and based on the information available to the manufacturer:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>the Member State in which the authorised representative acting on behalf of the manufacturer for the highest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;</li>
      <li>the Member State in which the importer placing on the market the highest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;</li>
      <li>the Member State in which the distributor making available on the market the highest number of products with digital elements of that manufacturer is established;</li>
      <li>the Member State in which the highest number of users of products with digital elements of that manufacturer are located.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In relation to the third subparagraph, point (d), a manufacturer may submit notifications related to any subsequent actively exploited vulnerability or severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements to the same CSIRT designated as coordinator to which it first reported.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    After becoming aware of an actively exploited vulnerability or a severe incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements, the manufacturer shall inform the impacted users of the product with digital elements, and where appropriate all users, of that vulnerability or incident and, where necessary, of any risk mitigation and corrective measures that the users can deploy to mitigate the impact of that vulnerability or incident, where appropriate in a structured, machine-readable format that is easily automatically processable.
    Where the manufacturer fails to inform the users of the product with digital elements in a timely manner, the notified CSIRTs designated as coordinators may provide such information to the users when considered to be proportionate and necessary for preventing or mitigating the impact of that vulnerability or incident.
  </li>

  <li>
    By 11 December 2025, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 of this Regulation to supplement this Regulation by specifying the terms and conditions for applying the cybersecurity-related grounds in relation to delaying the dissemination of notifications as referred to in Article 16(2) of this Regulation. The Commission shall cooperate with the CSIRTs network established pursuant to Article 15 of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and ENISA in preparing the draft delegated acts.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify further the format and procedures of the notifications referred to in this Article as well as in Articles 15 and 16. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2). The Commission shall cooperate with the CSIRTs network and ENISA in preparing those draft implementing acts.

  <summary><strong>Article 15 - Voluntary reporting</strong> Anyone (including manufacturers) may voluntarily report vulnerabilities, threats, incidents, and near misses to the CSIRT coordinator or ENISA; reports are processed via Article 16, manufacturers are informed if others report severe cases, and confidentiality and “no extra duties” protections apply.</summary>
  <br/>
  <ol>
  <li>
    Manufacturers as well as other natural or legal persons may notify any vulnerability contained in a product with digital elements as well as cyber threats that could affect the risk profile of a product with digital elements on a voluntary basis to a CSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA.
  </li>

  <li>
    Manufacturers as well as other natural or legal persons may notify any incident having an impact on the security of the product with digital elements as well as near misses that could have resulted in such an incident on a voluntary basis to a CSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA.
  </li>

  <li>
    The CSIRT designated as coordinator or ENISA shall process the notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16.
    <p>The CSIRT designated as coordinator may prioritise the processing of mandatory notifications over voluntary notifications.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Where a natural or legal person other than the manufacturer notifies an actively exploited vulnerability or a severe incident having an impact on the security of a product with digital elements in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2, the CSIRT designated as coordinator shall without undue delay inform the manufacturer.
  </li>

  <li>
    The CSIRTs designated as coordinators as well as ENISA shall ensure the confidentiality and appropriate protection of the information provided by a notifying natural or legal person.
    Without prejudice to the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, voluntary reporting shall not result in the imposition of any additional obligations upon a notifying natural or legal person to which it would not have been subject had it not submitted the notification.

  <summary><strong>Article 16 - Establishment of a single reporting platform</strong> ENISA must run a single reporting platform for CRA notifications, CSIRTs must quickly share notifications to other affected Member States (with tightly limited delay options), inform market surveillance authorities, and ENISA must secure the platform and coordinate technical specs with the CSIRTs network.</summary>
  <br/>
  <ol>
  <li>
    For the purposes of the notifications referred to in Article 14(1) and (3) and Article 15(1) and (2) and in order to simplify the reporting obligations of manufacturers, a single reporting platform shall be established by ENISA.
    The day-to-day operations of that single reporting platform shall be managed and maintained by ENISA.
    The architecture of the single reporting platform shall allow Member States and ENISA to put in place their own electronic notification end-points.
  </li>

  <li>
    After receiving a notification, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification shall, without delay, disseminate the notification via the single reporting platform to the CSIRTs designated as coordinators on the territory of which the manufacturer has indicated that the product with digital elements has been made available.
    <br/>
      In exceptional circumstances and, in particular, upon request by the manufacturer and in light of the level of sensitivity of the notified information as indicated by the manufacturer under Article 14(2), point (a), of this Regulation, the dissemination of the notification may be delayed based on justified cybersecurity-related grounds for a period of time that is strictly necessary, including where a vulnerability is subject to a coordinated vulnerability disclosure procedure as referred to in Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555.
      Where a CSIRT decides to withhold a notification, it shall immediately inform ENISA about the decision and provide both a justification for withholding the notification as well as an indication of when it will disseminate the notification in accordance with the dissemination procedure laid down in this paragraph.
      ENISA may support the CSIRT on the application of cybersecurity-related grounds in relation to delaying the dissemination of the notification.
    <br/>
      In particularly exceptional circumstances, where the manufacturer indicates in the notification referred to in Article 14(2), point (b):
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        that the notified vulnerability has been actively exploited by a malicious actor and, according to the information available, it has been exploited in no other Member State than the one of the CSIRT designated as coordinator to which the manufacturer has notified the vulnerability;
      </li>
      <li>
        that any immediate further dissemination of the notified vulnerability would likely result in the supply of information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the essential interests of that Member State; or
      </li>
      <li>
        that the notified vulnerability poses an imminent high cybersecurity risk stemming from the further dissemination;
      </li>
    </ol>
<br/>
      only the information that a notification was made by the manufacturer, the general information about the product, the information on the general nature of the exploit and the information that security related grounds were raised are to be made available simultaneously to ENISA until the full notification is disseminated to the CSIRTs concerned and ENISA.
      Where, based on that information, ENISA considers that there is a systemic risk affecting security in the internal market, it shall recommend to the recipient CSIRT that it disseminate the full notification to the other CSIRTs designated as coordinators and to ENISA itself.
  </li>

  <li>
    After receiving a notification of an actively exploited vulnerability in a product with digital elements or of a severe incident having an impact on the security of a product with digital elements, the CSIRTs designated as coordinators shall provide the market surveillance authorities of their respective Member States with the notified information necessary for the market surveillance authorities to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation.
  </li>

  <li>
    ENISA shall take appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the single reporting platform and the information submitted or disseminated via the single reporting platform.
    It shall notify without undue delay any security incident affecting the single reporting platform to the CSIRTs network as well as to the Commission.
  </li>

  <li>
    ENISA, in cooperation with the CSIRTs network, shall provide and implement specifications on the technical, operational and organisational measures regarding the establishment, maintenance and secure operation of the single reporting platform referred to in paragraph 1, including at least the security arrangements related to the establishment, operation and maintenance of the single reporting platform, as well as the electronic notification end-points set up by the CSIRTs designated as coordinators at national level and ENISA at Union level, including procedural aspects to ensure that, where a notified vulnerability has no corrective or mitigating measures available, information about that vulnerability is shared in line with strict security protocols and on a need-to-know basis.
  </li>

  <li>
    Where a CSIRT designated as coordinator has been made aware of an actively exploited vulnerability as part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure procedure as referred to in Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the CSIRT designated as coordinator initially receiving the notification may delay the dissemination of the relevant notification via the single reporting platform based on justified cybersecurity-related grounds for a period that is no longer than is strictly necessary and until consent for disclosure by the involved coordinated vulnerability disclosure parties is given.
    That requirement shall not prevent manufacturers from notifying such a vulnerability on a voluntary basis in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Article.

## Chapter III - Conformity of the Product with Digital Elements

<details>
  <summary><strong>Article 27 - Presumption of conformity</strong> Compliance with published harmonised standards, Commission “common specifications”, or certain EU cybersecurity certification schemes creates a presumption of CRA Annex I conformity, and a “substantial” EU cybersecurity certificate can remove some third-party conformity assessment duties.</summary>
  <br/>
  <ol>
  <li>
    Products with digital elements and processes put in place by the manufacturer which are in conformity with harmonised standards or parts thereof, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I covered by those standards or parts thereof.
    <p>
      The Commission shall, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, request one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards for the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation.
      When preparing standardisation requests for this Regulation, the Commission shall strive to take into account existing European and international standards for cybersecurity that are in place or under development in order to simplify the development of harmonised standards, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing common specifications covering technical requirements that provide a means to comply with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I for products with digital elements that fall within the scope of this Regulation.
    <p>Those implementing acts shall be adopted only where the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        the Commission has requested, pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a harmonised standard for the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I and:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>the request has not been accepted;</li>
          <li>the harmonised standards addressing that request are not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; or</li>
          <li>the harmonised standards do not comply with the request; and</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        no reference to harmonised standards covering the relevant essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 and no such reference is expected to be published within a reasonable period.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Before preparing the draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers that the conditions in paragraph 2 of this Article have been fulfilled.
  </li>

  <li>
    When preparing the draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission shall take into account the views of relevant bodies and shall duly consult all relevant stakeholders.
  </li>

  <li>
    Products with digital elements and processes put in place by the manufacturer which are in conformity with the common specifications established by implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or parts thereof, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I covered by those common specifications or parts thereof.
  </li>

  <li>
    Where a harmonised standard is adopted by a European standardisation organisation and proposed to the Commission for the purpose of publishing its reference in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall assess the harmonised standard in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
    When a reference of a harmonised standard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall repeal the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or parts thereof which cover the same essential cybersecurity requirements as those covered by that harmonised standard.
  </li>

  <li>
    Where a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely satisfy the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I, it shall inform the Commission thereof by submitting a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that detailed explanation and may, if appropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification in question.
  </li>

  <li>
    Products with digital elements and processes put in place by the manufacturer for which an EU statement of conformity or certificate has been issued under a European cybersecurity certification scheme adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Annex I in so far as the EU statement of conformity or European cybersecurity certificate, or parts thereof, cover those requirements.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 of this Regulation to supplement this Regulation by specifying the European cybersecurity certification schemes adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 that can be used to demonstrate conformity of products with digital elements with the essential cybersecurity requirements or parts thereof as set out in Annex I to this Regulation.
    Furthermore, the issuance of a European cybersecurity certificate issued under such schemes, at least at assurance level ‘substantial’, eliminates the obligation of a manufacturer to carry out a third-party conformity assessment for the corresponding requirements, as set out in Article 32(2), points (a) and (b), and Article 32(3), points (a) and (b), of this Regulation.
